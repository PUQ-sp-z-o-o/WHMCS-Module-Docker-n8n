5. **Self-Hosting and Privacy**  
    With n8n, you have the option to host your workflows on your own infrastructure, giving you full control over the data and ensuring privacy. This is particularly important for businesses that require compliance with data protection regulations or have sensitive information that should not leave their environment.
6. **Scalability**
